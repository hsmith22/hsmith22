Hi, Iâ€™m Hugh Smith (@hsmith22), a Science-Computing Major at the University of Notre Dame. I'm interested in Data Analytics, Software Engineering, and Project Management. I'm currently taking Operating Systems Principles and Science Computing with Python courses, with a primary focus on python. In the past I've also worked with C, C++, mySQL, and shell scripting. I'd like to develop applications which are real-world solutions through software engineering.
You can reach me via my email, hughgsmith18@gmail.com.
